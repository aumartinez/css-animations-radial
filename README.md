CSS Animations Radial Progress Bar

## The progress bar

The progress bar uses a rotating using @keyframes, the trick is to cover half of the circle 
while it is being rotated and then animate a second circle. Leave the first circle rotated and remove/hide the element used to cover the first circle.
